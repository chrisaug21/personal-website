            <h1 style="margin-bottom: 0.25rem;">My Career Journey</h1>
            <p class="lead" style="margin: 0 0 1rem 0;">This timeline tells the story of my adventures across different industriesâ€”from print production to education, healthcare to transportation, workplace tech to video marketing. Each jump wasn't random; I've always been drawn to new challenges and learning opportunities. I guess you could say I'm allergic to getting too comfortable in one space!</p>
            
            <br>
            
            <p class="lead" style="margin: 0 0 1rem 0;">Along the way, I've discovered what really drives me: building teams that get stuff done. I love empowering product managers and engineers to solve real problems with technology that actually changes how people live and work. The most rewarding moments? When our cross-functional teams create solutions that blow away customer expectations. Sure, I could have specialized in one industry, but the toolkit I've built by tackling diverse challenges has proven far more valuable. My career isn't defined by any single domainâ€”it's about rolling up my sleeves, bringing passionate people together, and turning complex problems into impactful solutions.</p>
